***   IDEs and Plug-ins
******************************

1. Install the Arduino IDE.
     Link:  http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
     Verify the USB drivers are installed and can access the Arduino Uno board;
     make note of the virtual COM port allocated to the driver--probably COM5 or COM6.
     
2. Install Eclipse (Kepler) in whatever combination results in both Java and C/C++ capabilities.
     Link:  http://eclipse.org/downloads/
     Recommended:  Install "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers", then
                   add the "Eclipse CDT (C/C++ Development Tooling) 8.2.1 Kepler"
                       plugin from Help > Eclipse Marketplace.
     
3. Install from the Eclipse Marketplace the plugin:  Arduino Eclipse IDE V2
   Configure it in Window > Preferences > Arduino [Arduino IDE Path] to point
   to the installation path of the Arduino IDE installed in  Step #1 above.

******************************
***   7-Zip
******************************
1. Install 7-Zip archive manager if you'll be building and modifying Arduino libraries
   such as TurtleBot.
     Link:  http://www.7-zip.org/
     
2. Insure the SYSTEM environment variable PATH contains the path to 7-Zip, so Eclipse
   builds can access the 7z.exe executable.
   
******************************   
***   Project Details  
******************************

Arduino Library Building   
1. Add the following post-build command in
   [Project] > Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings | Build Steps > Post-build steps (one line):
   
   cmd '/c cd .. && del TurtleBot.zip & 7z a -x@zipExcludes.list TurtleBot.zip *.cpp *.h keywords.txt examples'
   
2. Make note of the linked folders under the "arduino" folder for:
     core      : ArduinoPlatformPath\cores\arduino
     variant   : ArduinoPinPath\standard
     Others as needed:
       Servo   : ArduinoLibPath\Servo\src   
   
   Add includes for them:
     "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/arduino/core}"
     "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/arduino/variant}"
     "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/arduino/Servo}"

   NOTE:  If anything will cause a fault in the compile, it's these paths.
